## Group Norms
    1. Our plan for check-ins is meeeting up everyday in a zoom meeting to go over our action plan for the day, we will also use slack to keep in touch with async work. 
    2. Our plan for the organization and workflow will be done using git projects. We chose this platform as it has fuctions that will be useful. We can assign tasks via this board and also move each action item through stages of completion and view this in real time.
    3. When we all got together to discuss different approachs we had several different ways to come at this project. We settled on the design you see today as we felt it was more streamlined and made the most scense. For project organization we were all in agreement to use git projects.
    4. When we approached our code design we really looked at building out all our methods first, once we had functioning methods we then looked at refactoring those methods and using helper methods.
