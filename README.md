## Group Norms
1. Daily checkins with a retro on friday. 
2. Matt is leading us with the git project board, which we will continue to check a few times a day and be sure to keep it updated. Status of PRs will be updated there, and we will push to the main repo as a squad.
3. We were all in agreement to use git projects so we can easily streamline our deliverables and git projects made the most scense with its built in functions.
4. We broke down the methods to see what data we will need. We wanted to break everything down to small parts to get a good picture of what and how we wanted to tackle this project.
